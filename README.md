# GB_Input_Test
![til](https://github.com/twhiching/GB_Input_Test/blob/master/GB_Input_Test/GB_Input_Test.gif)

This is a short demo I created when trying to learn about the gameboy development. 
In order to help me quickly hit the ground running I used the gingerbread library (https://github.com/ahrnbom/gingerbread) to help me not
rewrite alot of boiler plate code.I also used aseprite to draw my sprites and then used a tool called Gameboy Tile Data Generator 
(https://github.com/chrisantonellis/gbtdg) to help conevrt my png sprites into the apporiate .inc files. In order to run the demo, 
just make sure to locate the rom inside of the repository. It is titled *input_test.gb*. 
Then load the rom onto your choice of gameboy emulator, or onto a flashcart to be played on real hardware.
